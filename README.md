## History

K2 does a lot of heavy lifting creating, updating and destroying Kubernetes clusters in the cloud. Failures can occur for a variety of reasons and this tool helps us understand when and where tasks are commonly failing. This tool does not collect any personal information and the crash data is used internally for development purposes.
